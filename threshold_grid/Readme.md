# Thresholding Peak Side Ratio : 
I wanted to show the practicality of optimizing a classifier for sensitivity. In figure A below, 
the goal is to move the decision threshold to the optimum

## sensitivity-specificty tradeoff in the classifier
I run the function for several iterations, I got this

## Recall Peak Side Ratio Histogram from another part of this work

It can be seen how it looks like in terms of frame-based recognition,
